## üîÑ App Flow  

### First Setup (when user installs & opens app)
- Initialize Flutter bindings, timezone DB, Hive, and notifications.  
- Request notification permissions.  
- Load prayer times from Hive or API and schedule notifications.  
- Cache 31 days of prayer times for efficiency.  
- WorkManager task runs every 48h to refresh cache if less than 7 days remain.  

### Reopening the App
- Re-initialize services.  
- Skip past notifications (no duplicates thanks to deterministic IDs).  
- WorkManager ensures notifications are always valid without reopening the app.  

---

## üöÄ Installation  

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `flutter pub get`  
3. No Firebase setup required (local files + APIs only)  
4. Run with `flutter run`  

---

## üß™ Testing  

- Unit & widget tests in progress.  
- Focus on notification scheduling, Hive caching, and UI widget behaviors.  

---

## üìç Why This Project Matters  

This project demonstrates:  
- **Clean Architecture** applied in Flutter.  
- **Riverpod** state management.  
- **Offline-first design** with caching & file storage.  
- **Background tasks** & **local notifications**.  
- **Complex multimedia handling** (streaming, downloading, global playback).  

It‚Äôs both a **real-world utility app for Muslims** and a **portfolio showcase of advanced Flutter practices**.
